The project is set up under Intellije IDEA 2016.1.1

To run the project, just run the main class. The attributes in the main class define the data source file,
the brand factor and the ammount of years to simulate.

The output of the program will be just total numbers in the console and all the policies after the simulation in an
external file, as a CSV so it can be easily visualized with any other software.

Please, note that the xslx file should be clear of any other text than the values - for instance, the equations.

The first row is still the one defining the columns' names.
